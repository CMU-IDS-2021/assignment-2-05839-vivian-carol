              After exploring the data, we were mostly intrigued by the following features of each row in our data set: the danceability, energy, tempo, and valence of each work.
              This led us to the realization that with about half a century of data and a sizable list of features to analyze, what we most wanted to visualize was the evolution and 
              musical tendencies of artists with incredible diversity in their work.<br><br>With that goal in mind, we chose <strong>David Bowie</strong> for his extensive and musically-divergent career.
              Bowie is well-known for his eccentric music styles and wide-reaching influence from his start in the 60s to his death in 2016.
